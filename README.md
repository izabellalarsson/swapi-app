# SWAPI App

A very basic application usinging the [https://swapi.dev/](https://swapi.dev/) api to fetch data about the Star wars movies.

I decided to test out using [React query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) to fetch the data, and using [React router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) to navigate around the application. For the global state I am using [jotai](https://jotai.org/).
